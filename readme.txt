Overview: 
-The future of population will shape how we create businesses, develop social services, grow our infrastructure, build institutions, provide health care, and the like.
-Understanding the future of population will help equip us to be prepared for opportunities and challenges ahead!

Findings:
1) Africa's population will take off.  Asia's will start declining ~2055.
2) While life expectancy remains lower in Africa, further improvements will increase population.
3) Fertility rates will significantly shape future population (Africa's higher rates).
4) Illustration of future: There are more babies born in a year in Nigeria than in all of Europe.
5) Nearly all of the world's youth reside in developing nations.  The world's population will age considerably.
